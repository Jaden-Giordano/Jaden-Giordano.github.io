                <p class="white-text">    McDonalds has a decently high calorie menu and is infatuating our poor population, and Donald Trump has shown very aggressive views towards our precious poor little baby population. Therefore Donald Trump and McDonalds are ploying to take over the world. <br>    Many poor people eat at fast food restraunts because they dont have the time with their vicous work schedules, that leaves the very precious time to make meals out. Donald Trump has recently been working with McDonalds to add a chemical to McDonalds food that makes them work harder, but it makes them much more dumb and easier to sway. "Death to the niave!" - Trump

                <p class="white-text "> I has came to the attention that clapping and cheering wildly every few words a candidate say the audience MUST clap. WOOOHOO! Yeah! *Clap, clap, clap*. If you dont clap you will be kick out and called an asshole for not supporting the candidate you wanted to see the view of. Woohoo! *Clap, clap, clap*. Last night Ted Cruz stated "Audience: *aplauds and profusely cheers with emotion* Ted Cruz: The police have been treated horribly. Audience: *Crazy super intense profuse emotional clapping and cheering like no one has ever thought of it*". I decided criticize the audience and my roomates beat me up.

                  <p>Both God made man equal which means he made chicken and eggs equal. Why would anyone doubt or ask this question, of course it was both. Are you dumb or something? If both werent made at the same time the chicken wouldnt have another chicken to fertilize its other eggs, and the chicken would cease to exist. Also if the egg didnt have a chicken the egg wouldnt know how to live and would also cease to exist. Evolution is a lie and isnt a reliable answer so were just going to ignore it.</p>

                  <p>Who ever is more logical than me is illogical becuase how in the world is anyone supposed to defend a claim with less logic than the other person. The church is the only most logical source of knowledge, which is why Gallileo, Pathagoras, and Newton to go work so hard to give their ideas to the church, the church had to be sure their ideas were on their level of logic. If it is not on my level of logic I will not accept the information you are attempting to force into mind. I will not be made an idiot by your silly ideas.</p>
