            <p>Throughout your use of Github Collaboration you will become very fond of Pushing, Pulling, and Committing. The difference between the three and there uses are as follows:<br><br>
            Pulling: As you've already learned to get the files from Github to your computer you had to 'pull', thats what this does, e.g. if someone mad a change and put it up then you would 'pull' to get those changes.<br><br>
            Committing: Committing is how you update your changes in the SourceTree Application, or a way of commenting on your changes and putting them into a timeline.<br><br>
            Pushing: After committing you will 'push' to upload your changes (commit) to the Github servers.
